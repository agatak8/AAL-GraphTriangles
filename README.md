# AAL-GraphTriangles
WIP project

#### Given problem
There are n 2D points chosen in a way that no 3 points lay on the same line. Every pair of points is assigned either 0 or 1. Find and list all sets of three points where all the pairs are assigned the same number.
#### Core problem
Find and list all triangles (cliques/cycles of size 3) in a given n vertex graph and its complement (inverse) graph.
